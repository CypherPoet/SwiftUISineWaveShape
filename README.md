### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `SwiftUISineWaveShape` as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/CypherPoet/SwiftUISineWaveShape", .exact("0.0.1")),

)
```

From there, refer to `SwiftUISineWaveShape` as a "target dependency" in any of _your_ package's targets that need it.

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
          "SwiftUISineWaveShape",
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

Then simply `import SwiftUISineWaveShape` wherever you’d like to use it.
